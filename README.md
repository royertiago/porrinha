Porrinha

Assignment of the discipline INE5430 - Artificial Intelligence.

This is a game typically played on bars,
where the loser pays the beer (or some other penalty like that).
See the [game rules](game_rules.md) for more information.

The code is licensed under GPL version 3 or any later version.


Compiling
=========

To compile the game sources,
you need a `gcc`-compatible compiler
that supports C++14.
(The makefile uses the `CXX`, that can be set by the user
to an appropriate compiler.)

The game was tested with `gcc 4.9.1` and `clang 3.5.0`.


Implementing additional artificial intelligences
=================================================

The code of this repository is organized so that it is possible to have
several artificial intelligences battling simultaneously
in the same game.

See the [tutorial](tutorial.md) to creating your own artificial intelligence.
You should also read the documentation in the files
[`player.h`](player.h) and [`game/core.h`](game/core.h).

The remainder of this section deals with
the full specification that needs to be taken into account
when creating an artificial intelligence.
You only need to read further
if your AI does function calls at unusual moments
or needs custom build rules.

There is a [common interface](player.h) that must be implemented
by all artificial intelligences.
How this interface is used by the game is documented in the
[modus operandi][]

Each artificial intelligence is in a subdirectory
(normally a git submodule)
that follows some specific file structure.
The file structure is documented [here][file structure]

If your artificial intelligence does not have complicated build rules
and can be described as a set of `.cpp` and `.h`/`.hpp` files,
then reading the [modus operandi][] and the [file structure][]
should be enough.

If your artificial intelligence needs special build rules
with a custom makefile, you must also read the
[makefile conventions](makefile_conventions.md) of this repository.

[modus operandi]: modus_operandi.md
[file structure]: file_structure.md
