Game Rules
==========

From [wikipedia](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porrinha)

The game is played with at least two players.
Each player receive three chopsticks at the beginning of the game.

At each round, each player choose a number of chopsticks
(might be zero)
and show its hand, closed, in the table;
the other players should not see how many sticks one has chosen.

Each player, then, guess the total number of chopsticks
that have been chosen by all the players (including itself).
The guesses are said out loud in clockwise direction;
no two players can guess the same value.

When all players had made their guesses,
everyone open its hands and reveal the number of chosen chopsticks.
If some player made the right guess,
this player loses one of its chopsticks,
and become the first guesser of the next round.
If no one made the right guess, the first guesser of the next round
is the next player, in clockwise direction.

A player which loses all its chopsticks are removed from the game.
The last player in the table loses.
